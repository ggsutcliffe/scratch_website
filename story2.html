<p class="indent">Frank and Fred Play With Tommy</p>
<p class="indent"></p>
<p class="indent">One day Frank and Fred decided to go exploring. It was the day Tommy’s family came over and Frank, Fred and Tommy explored the house. There were three floors which meant lots to explore. The first floor was the basement. They found a pool table and started to play. Tommy dumped all the balls in the triangle. 
    <p class="indent">“Why don’t they fit?” Puzzled Frank . 
    <p class="indent">“Maybe there is an extra?” Fred suggested. 
    <p class="indent">“Maybe,” Tommy said, dropping an orange one on the carpet floor. 
    <p class="indent">“This game is too hard.” Frank said, trying to poke a green ball into the hole. Fred swiped his cue across the table knocking a bunch of balls on the carpet. 
    <p class="indent">“I won ha ha,” he said. 
    <p class="indent">“No, you just knocked them all off the table,” Frank complained. 
    <p class="indent">“I got two in,” defended Fred. 
    <p class="indent">“Let’s play bowling!” Tommy said excitedly. 
    <p class="indent">“Boy, this white one really stands out. It could be the bowling ball,” Frank figured. They lined up all the balls and took turns rolling the white ball at the other ones and knocking them all over the basement. 
    <p class="indent">“I wonder what the grownups are doing?" Fred said an hour later. 
    <p class="indent">“Earlier when I went upstairs to find a bathroom, I saw them at a table playing games,” said Frank.
    <p class="indent">“Let’s clean up the balls and go see,” said Tommy. Fred ran off to hide. 
    <p class="indent">“I’m not helping!” He said. 
    <p class="indent">“He's kidding,” Frank called to Fred. 
    <p class="indent">“Yeah sure,” Fred said, as he climbed into the crawl space and sat down under a box. Pffffftbbbsssssssd “ooh a whoopie cushion” Fred said excitedly “let’s go put it on Dad’s chair!” So Fred came out of  his hiding spot and they crept up the stairs to the second floor. 
    <p class="indent">“Look, there they are!” Frank whispered, peering out the sidelight. 
    <p class="indent">“I think they’re getting more boring adult games from the car,” Tommy observed. 
    <p class="indent">“That’s probably why they’re called board games, they make you bored,” decided Fred.
    <p class="indent">“Quick hide, I think they’re coming!” Frank shouted all of a sudden. They all ran into a closet at the top of the stairs. 
    <p class="indent">“Why are we hiding?” Fred whispered. “How are we going to put a whoopee cushion on their chair when we are hiding in a closet?” 
    <p class="indent">“Oh true, let’s try to find where the adults were, but we need to be fast.” Tommy said, crawling out of the closet. They looked around and found the kitchen and the table which was covered in games. Tommy’s little sister Emily was there eating apple pieces and dropping bananas on the floor.
    <p class="indent">“Where do we put it when we don’t know where anyone is going to be sitting?”  Tommy asked. 
    <p class="indent">“We could put it on the chair on the end of the table because that is where our dad usually sits”. Frank thought. 
    <p class="indent">“But what about my dad? He usually sits there too.” Tommy asked. “I guess it’s 50/50,” “Come hide around this corner, they’re coming!” Fred said hastily.They all ran around a corner and peeked out occasionally to look. 
    <p class="indent">“This time I get to deal.” They heard the door open and they could hear the adults talking. “I sat at the dealing spot though, and you're not getting it.” 
    <p class="indent">“Not if I get there first!” 
    <p class="indent">“I didn’t know the grownups acted so immature when we weren't around” Tommy remarked. 
    <p class="indent">“Here they come,” whispered Fred. Frank and Fred’s dad and Tommy’s dad were neck and neck pounding down the hallway to get the seat at the head of the table. Pffffftbbbsssssssd they both sat down at once. 
    <p class="indent">“Now what’s this all about?” Tommy’s dad slowly stood up looking around.
    <p class="indent">“Run,” Frank said. Then they tore off and Frank and Fred's Dad tried to get the kid’s Mothers to sit on the end of the table when they came. When Frank, Fred and Tommy got up to the second floor they decided to play hide and seek. Fred insisted that he be “it” because he won the pool game which was debatable but they didn’t want to be “it” anyways so they let him be “it”. He started counting and Frank and Tommy ran off to hide.When Fred decided he was quite finished counting, he ran off and passed by the adults. They were eating lots of tasty desserts. 
    <p class="indent">“That’s not fair,” he muttered. 
    <p class="indent">“Oh that's where you are, can you tell Tommy we're going soon?” Tommy’s dad said. 
    <p class="indent">“Probably,” Fred said. He ran off to hide because he didn’t want Tommy to leave. When the adults went to look for them they couldn’t find them because Tommy and Frank thought it was just Fred trying to get them to come out because he could not find them. It took two hours to round up the kids and Frank and Fred’s mom and Tommy's mom sat at the table drinking tea and visiting the whole time. In the end they all ended up sleeping over.
