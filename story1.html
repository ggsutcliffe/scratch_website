<p>Frank and Fred Move</p>

	One day Frank and Fred decided to move. It was because they didn’t like living in Vancouver. Frank, Fred 
  (who are both 5 years old, but they are not twins) and their parents Billy and Mary live in a little apartment
  . Frank and Fred didn’t like it because it was boring and there was no snow or places to play outside. So 
  they told their parents their plan. 
“Where would we go though?” Their dad said. ”The internet says that we 
  only have to go, like, 50 kilometers to get snow.” Frank said, 
“As long as we drive in the right direction”. 
”Sounds like a great idea,” said Mom. 
“And if you guys don’t have to put wheels on your sleds just to go sledding, it would be great,” Dad said. So
they put their stuff in the car, sold their apartment and the next morning they drove off north to find a house 
to buy. They drove up Highway 99, the Number 1, the Number 3, the Number 97, the- 
“Holy moly they have letters now”! Fred exclaimed. The 97c the 5a the Number 8 the Number 1 again the Number 12. 
They drove and drove. “I’m so tired”, whined Fred. “I think we’re driving in circles”. Hours of driving later 
they got lost and when their parents pulled over to look at a map, Frank and Fred jumped out and played in the 
snow. Half an hour later they found an old dirt road buried in underbrush and snow. They showed their dad and 
together they found a broken exit sign. It said, “EXIT One Zillion and a Half. Little Town Gas & Groceries 50 Km”. 
Dad was excited about it and immediately began bushwhacking to clear it up. When he was done, he jumped into 
the driver’s seat and enthusiastically started the car. 
“Honey, may I drive”? Mom asked because she was scared of Dad driving on logging roads because he drove fast. 
“Sure“ he said, “fine”. He sounded disappointed. Off they went. A couple minutes later they drove by a wooden sign
that read, “You’ll regret going past 50 km/h”, another sign later read, “It means you’ll die if you are on a tricycle”. 
Another one said, “Don’t try this at home!” There were countless signs as far as you could see. Eventually they got 
to Little Town. Appropriately named, it was very little. There were two roads, one going in and one going out. While 
their dad went to get gas at the gas station, Frank, Fred and their mom went and knocked on doors to find out if there
was anywhere they could stay. The first house no one answered because it was the preacher's house. He is very busy 
because he has every job in the church and is considered the mayor too. The next house they knocked on, a kid their 
age answered. 
“Hi I’m Tommy,” he said. 
“Is there any place to stay for the night? Frank and Fred’s mom asked. 
“Are you new here”? Tommy asked. 
“Yes we are,” Frank said.
“That’s rare,” Tommy said. ”Did you see my signs?” 
“Yeah they were so funny!” Fred piped up. 
“Let’s not get off topic” their mom said. 
“Oh“ Tommey said “Oops, well if you were really desperate you could go live in the house on the hill, but it’s haunted, and creepy, and old”.                                             
Frank and Fred’s mom, who didn’t believe a word Tommy said, said, 
"I'm sure it will be a lovely place to live”. Tommy’s mom, who just came to the door, said 
“Hello I’m Sarah, Tommy’s mom”. 
“Nice to meet you Sarah. I'm Mary, their mom”. 
“And we’re Frank and Fred,“ said Fred.  Then their parents started having a boring adult conversation So Frank, Fred and 
Tommy went and ran around Tommy's house until Frank and Fred’s dad came and shortly ended the boring adult conversation. 
So Frank and Fred’s family said goodbyes and left to settle into their new home.The next day Frank and Fred’s mom invited 
Tommy’s family over. So Frank, Fred and Tommy explored the house and ran around in the woods while the adults played boring 
adult board games and talked about boring adult stuff and Tommy’s little sister Emily sat in her high chair watching the 
adults and eating apple slices. 

The end for now, to be continued next Sunday.
