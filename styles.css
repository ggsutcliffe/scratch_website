<p class="indent">Frank and Fred Move</p>
<p class="indent">
  One day Frank and Fred decided to move. It was because they didn’t like living in Vancouver. Frank, Fred 
  (who are both 5 years old, but they are not twins) and their parents Billy and Mary live in a little apartment.
  Frank and Fred didn’t like it because it was boring and there was no snow or places to play outside. So 
  they told their parents their plan.
